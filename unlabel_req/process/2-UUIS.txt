The Unified University Inventory System is to integrate 3 faculties data bases providing Web interface that allows user to access and manage the integrated inventory.
The Unified University Inventory System need to guarantee a secure access to the data from outside university at any time during working hours.
The Unified University Inverntory System can transferring Assects.
Within the same department, data base can be updated directly without any request.
Inter department, request must be approved by a DA group member and faculty group member unless it came from a higher level group.
Inter faculties transfer, request can be made by any authorised user and approved by faculty group or higher level.
Transfer outside university should be approved by the university group.
The Unified University Inventory System should can edit assets.
Any administrative level user or inventory user can edit an asset that belongs to its department; same thing for faculty user, or university user; in order to make modification if he is authorised to do it.
The Unified University Inventory System should can modifying assects.
All fields of an edited asset can be modified except Ids.
A bulk entry file can be used.
The Unified University Inventory System can add inventory assects.
Any DA group member or authorised inventory group member asset is owned by the department.
Any faculty member can add all related departments inventory.
Any university group member can add all assets in the inventory.
A bulk entry can be used to add many assets.
The Unified University Inventory System can create request to borrow an asset or a reserve a location.
The request can be made by any authorised user.
After creation a request still pending waiting to be approved by an administrative level user according to that have this authority.
An inventory user should check returned asset and update inventory.
IT group members can create a new space and modify floor structure when they receive an exception request from any administrative level.
Any administration level or authorised inventory group member can display all pending requests waiting for approval from this level and approve those requests.
When request is treated user is notified by email.
Request is added to the waiting for execution list Inventory is updated when user receive requested asset.
Authentication is made by user name and a password for all users.
Administrative level working on administration computer.
Any administrative level user can delegate another user to execute some or all his authorized actions.
And this user acquires the role of inventory administrator.
The modification operations that the Inventory Admin can perform on inventory items.
The Inventory Admin must be authenticated before performing any related operations.
The Unified University Inventory System assumes that the user understands the outcome of each operation, with no option to revert actions.
The goal of this requirement is to present all possible modifications that the Inventory Admin can perform.
In the basic course of action, the Inventory Admin starts by searching for an asset, then edits the asset, and finally modifies the asset's properties.
In an alternate course, if an administrator or an authorized inventory user is working on the approval list or execution list, they can also edit and modify the asset properties.
There are several exceptional courses to consider.
In the first exceptional scenario, the Inventory Admin searches for and edits an asset, then attempts to remove the asset from the inventory, but The Unified University Inventory System displays an error message because the asset cannot be modified.
In the second exceptional scenario, the Inventory Admin searches for and edits an asset but lacks sufficient privileges to edit it, resulting in an error message.
In the third exceptional scenario, the Inventory Admin searches for an asset, but no asset is found, leading to an error message.
Upon successful modification, The Unified University Inventory System state changes according to the modifications made.
The actors involved in this process include the Inventory Admin, the Inventory System, and the Authentication System.
To complete these operations, The Unified University Inventory System includes the Search use case, Edit use case, and Authentication use case.
It is assumed that the hosting system and servers support all operations, ensuring the requirement can be executed smoothly.
